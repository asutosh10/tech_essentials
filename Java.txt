What is JDK, JRE and JVM
4 pillars
	Inheritance - > Exception inheritence
	Polymorphism -> main method overloading
	Encapsulation
	Abstraction
SOLID principles
Data Types
	Stringbuilder ns StringBuffer
	String vs New String
	bytes of datatypes
	Wrapper Class
	Autoboxing and Unboxing
Type Casting
Access Modifiers
Constructor / Constructor inheritance
Overloading and Overriding
this vs super
finally vs final vs finalize
Abstract
Interface -> Diamond Problem super keyword
	Marker vs functional
	Comparable vs Comparator
Collection
	Arraylist vs LinkedList (uses and internal working)
	Hashmap (Internal working)
	Concurrent Hashmap vs hashmap
	vector vs arraylist
	failfast vs failsafe iterator
	Hashset
Exception Handling
	Types-> Checked vs Unchecked
	try-catch
	explicit throw
	implicit throw
	try-with
hashcode vs equals
Thread
	Runnable Interface
	Daemon tools
	join(), wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
	Thread Pool
	Executor Service/ Implementations
	Deadlock
	BlockingQueue
File Handling
	Reading
	Writing -> how to append
Inner Class
Anonymous Class
Generic Classes
Serialization -> transient || serailVersionUID
Consumer, Predicate and Supplier
Lambda
Streams -> map || fiter || forEach || Collectors. mapping || groupingBy || joining || IntStream || Stream<Object> || mapToObj || mapToInt
Heap Memory and Stack Memory
Old generation vs young generation
Permgen vs metaspace
