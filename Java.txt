What is JDK, JRE and JVM
What is JIT
4 pillars
	Inheritance - > Exception through classes in inheritence
	Polymorphism -> main method overloading
	Encapsulation
	Abstraction -> constructor in abstract classes 
SOLID principles
Data Types
	Stringbuilder ns StringBuffer
	String vs New String
	bytes of datatypes
	Wrapper Class || -128 to 127 Integer value will be equal rest not 124==124 565 != 565
	Autoboxing and Unboxing
Type Casting
Access Modifiers
Constructor / Constructor inheritance
Overloading and Overriding
this vs super
finally vs final vs finalize
Abstract
Interface -> Diamond Problem super keyword
	Marker vs functional
	Comparable vs Comparator
Collection
	Arraylist vs LinkedList (uses and internal working)
	Hashmap (Internal working) -> null which bucket is it stored || Collision and rehashing || why implement both equals and hashcode
	Concurrent Hashmap vs hashmap
	vector vs arraylist
	failfast vs failsafe iterator
Exception Handling
	Types-> Checked vs Unchecked
	order of exception catching
	multiple exception caught in a line -> |
	try-catch
	explicit throw
	implicit throw
	try-with
hashcode vs equals
Thread
	Runnable Interface
	Daemon tools
	join(), wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
	Thread Pool
	Executor Service/ Implementations
	Deadlock
	BlockingQueue
	CompletableFuture -> creation chaining, exception handling
	Singleton Double lock mechanism
File Handling
	Reading
	Writing -> how to append
Inner Class
Anonymous Class
Generic and wildcards -> bounding both
Serialization -> transient || serailVersionUID
Consumer, Predicate and Supplier
Lambda
Streams -> map || fiter || forEach || Collectors. mapping || groupingBy || joining || IntStream || Stream<Object> || mapToObj || mapToInt
	group by dept order by salary from list of employees
	find the highest salary from a map (highest can be 2)
Heap Memory and Stack Memory
Old generation vs young generation
Permgen vs metaspace
