It is a container orchestation tool

Availability
Scalability
Disaster Recovery

Node -> virtual or physical machine

Kubelet -> It is a kebernetes process that makes it possible for cluster to talk to each other 

Worker nodes -> Here the actual applications are running

Master nodes -> Runs kubernetes processes that are necessary to run and manage the cluster properly
	API Server -> entrypoint to kubernetes cluster
	UI , API, CLI all talk to API server to connetct with the cluster

Controller Manager -> keeps track of what is happening in the cluster
Schedulers -> ensures pod placement
etcd -> kubernetes backing store
	stores the state of the container

Virtual Network -> creates one unified machine

Pod -> Smallest unit in kebernetes
	Abstraction over container
	1 application per pod
	Each pod gets its own IP address (internal IP address)
	Each time a pod dies a new IP address gets created

Service -> It is a permanent IP address attached to a pod
	Lifecycle of pod and service are not connected so even if the pod dies the IP remains same
	2 types internal service (not accessible to the public, ex-db/ by default) and external service

Ingress -> It is the actual IP that forwards to service
	ex-> service can be https://4070.60.70
	     ingress can be https://myapp.com

ConfigMap -> External configuration of your application
	stored in plain text

Secret -> It is like ConfigMap but it is used to store secret data, credentials
	stored in base64 encoded
	and also other encryptions

volume -> it maps the container to external storage(local/cloud)

Deployment -> It is another abstraction over pods / Blueprint for pods
	It is used for stateless apps

StatefulSet -> It is also another abstraction over pods
	It is used for stateful apps/databases

Configuration File -> It is a yaml file given to the master node for deployments
	has 3 parts -> metadata, specification, status

minikube -> to run kubernetes on local, both worker and master are on the same node
kubectl -> kubernetes CLI for both minikube as well as all kubernetes hosts

kubectl get node -> shows all nodes

kubectl get pod -> shows all pods

kubectl get service -> shows all services

kubectl apply -f <file_name> -> to create a yaml file in kubernetes cluster

kubectl get all -> to get all deployments, services

kubectl get configmap -> to get config map

kubectl get secret -> to get secret

kubectl --help

kubectl get --help

kubectl describe service/pod/configmap <name_of_the_component>

kubectl logs <pod_name>

kubectl get service/pod/node -o wide -> for a long description
